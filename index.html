		<h1>My name is Casey</h1>
		<p>Howdy! I'm a comp-sci student who started out college wanting to go into game development before realizing I wanted to make a career out of programming. I've been a self-taught programmer for the past ~5 years and have picked up web development in the past year or so, so this is all pretty familiar to me! I already have my own personal website and portfolio hosted on Neocities.</p>

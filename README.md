My GitHub account is one that I made in a previous semester at Wake Tech for a Simulation and Game Development course.
I created this repository for CTI.110, it currently only has a README file, but will accumulate more files in the future.

In order to clone this repository, I opened GitHub Desktop--which was already installed previous to the lab--and clicked on the "File" tab in the top left corner of the window, then clicked on "Clone repository" in the displayed drop-down menu. Under "Your repositories," this repository was displayed, which I clicked on and then clicked "Clone" in order to clone the repository onto my computer.
